BasicBlocksSimulink file: It shows the implementation of relay block using basic blocks like switch, constant and delay.
Subsystem file: It contains the code generated for the relay implementation.

Relay block: Relay block in Simulink has two limits - 1. upper limit and 2. lower limit, when the input is equal to or above upper limit relay output switches to "HIGH" state. If input is equal to or below lower limit relay output switches to "LOW" state.
